# Pre bootcamp challenges by Umuzi

1. Task 1: Convert this pseudocode into actual code (Python).
2. Task 2: Convert this pseudocode into actual code (BODMAS).
3. Task 3: Write a function that takes 2 numbers as input. If either of the numbers is 65, OR if the sum of the numbers is 65 then return true. Otherwise return false.
4. Task 4: Write a function that takes 2 numbers as input. If either of the numbers is 3 AND the sum of the numbers contains a 3 then return true. Otherwise return false
5. Task 5: Write a function that takes in three numbers. These numbers represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function should return the area of a triangle.
6. Task 6: White a function that takes in three numbers and returns the maximum number. Do this without using any builtin methods. Write your own logic from scratch.
Bonus: How can you change the code so it can take in any number of numbers?
7. Task 7: Write a function that takes in a number representing the temperature in Celsius and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. Write another function that does the opposite (Fereignheit to Celsius)
8. Task 8: Make a function to convert any number into hours and minutes. (For example, 71 will become “1 hour, 11 minutes”; 133 will become “2 hours, 13 minutes”.)
9. Task 9: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
10. Task 10: Write a function that takes in a string and then prints out all the vowels in the string. Make sure it can deal with capital letters and small letters.
11. Task 11: Make a function that takes two strings as input, and outputs the common characters/letters that they share. (For example, Input: ‘house’, ‘computers’ . Output: ‘Common letters: o, u, e, s’)
